## Welcome to MTracker

**MTracker** is a tool for automatic splining tongue shapes in ultrasound images by harnessing the power of deep convolutional neural networks. It is developed at the Department of Linguistics, University of Michgian to address the need of spining a large-scale ultrasound project. MTracker also allows for human correction by interfacing with GetContour developed by Mark Tiede in the Haskins Laboratory.
